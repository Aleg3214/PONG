# PONG
I re-created the old arcade game PONG exclusively with code written by me in C.

Pong has many functionalities:
you can register and login into the game;
You can delete your account if you desire to;
You can view a scoreboard of the best players;
Once logged, you can manage your account by deciding to play a game, view your past matches and delete your account.

The game contains on-screen instruction and a simple graphic to remind of the (g)old arcade games.
ENJOY!!!
